# Superflat-Create-Modpack


**NOTE**
This github repository is ONLY for issues. Thanks!



Since there aren't any good superflat create modpacks out there, I decided to make my own

**INSTRUCTIONS**
1. Run this modpack and create a new world. You won't use this world, it's just to create the "saves" folder
2. Create a new superflat world with structures in an unmodded instance of Minecraft in 1.17.
2. Open file explorer (finder on mac), and navigate to (User)>Appdata>Roaming>.minecraft>saves>(whatever you named your world)
3. Click on the folder button next to the play button in the Modrinth app
4. Open the "saves" folder
5. Move the world folder to the "saves" folder associated with this modpack
6. Enjoy!


**PLANNED FEATURES**
- Ability to get pottery sherds
- Ability to get smithing templates that currently are impossible to get
- Ability to get different types of frogs, goats, sniffer eggs, ice, snow, axalotls, rabbits, mycelium, and glow lichen
- AN ACTUAL PROGRESSION SYSTEM
